**Sustaining and Strengthening City Climate Action in the COVID-19 crisis for a green
and climate-resilient recovery (ClimateCitiesRecovery)**

Cities in developed and developing countries have emerged as critical actors in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to climate change impacts. Although the COVID-19 crisis has disrupted habits, short-term economic development and carbon emissions, it is less clear whether it represents a critical juncture beyond which cities will shift towards enduring low-carbon and climate-resilient pathways.1 This study investigates cities as potential drivers of green and climate-resilient recovery, seeking to identify factors that influence whether cities embark on low-carbon and resilient pathways, return to prior unsustainable pathways, or backtrack on climate commitments and head to unsustainable pathways. By comparing climate commitments of cities in developed and developing countries, we aim to challenge conventional paradigms about development and recovery from crises which often entail investments that lock-in high-carbon and unsustainable development. Our aim is to shed light on those factors that can be harnessed - and actions that can be taken - by individual cities and networks of cities, to support a green and climate-resilient recovery.

# **Publication for which this dataset is used:** Early engagement and co-benefits strengthen cities' climate commitments

**Abstract:** Cities are key players in the race to tackle climate change. However, escalating crises due to pandemics, conflict, and climate change challenge their ability to lead the way in climate action. Understanding how to support ambitious and sustained city climate action (i.e. measures taken to limit climate change or its impacts) in the context of these crises is essential. Here we use global data on 793 cities from the CDP 2021 platform to assess how COVID-19 - a major crisis of our times - has affected cities’ reported climate commitments and actions, and the factors associated with these impacts. We find climate actions persist despite funding shortfalls; yet only 43% of cities have implemented green recovery interventions. Co-benefits of climate action (e.g. health outcomes) and early engagement on sustainability issues (e.g. via climate networks) are associated with sustained climate action and finance during COVID-19, and green recovery interventions. Cities should strengthen sustainability co-benefits and relationships with coalitions of actors on sustainability issues to support durable climate commitments during crises.

# Installation & use (Contents of file: Notes.txt)
1. Recommended to download entire folders (cc_org, cc_analys), to maintain subdirectory order

2. CC_org folder contains two sub-folders: inputs and do-files

2a.CC_org "Inputs" contains:
> Non-cdp data from multiple sources in one file (see Extended Data Table 1 of paper). 
> CDP 2021 data that hjas been processed using file C0.0. This dataset can be run using do-files C1.0 onwards.
> The raw CDP data can be downloaded by readers from https://data.cdp.net/ NOTE: it is very large!
	

2b. CC_org "do-files" folder contains: 
> Stata code (in separate do-files) for organising and cleaning the raw data, and generating variables used in analyses reported in the paper and Supplementary Information 
> Run through CC_org do-files in alpha-numeric order starting from C1.0 ending in Z1.0.
> The "C0.0 do-file is to be used on the raw CDP 2021 data (obtained from https://data.cdp.net/)
> Do-file N1.0 refers to the non-CDP data do-file. This can be run anytime.
> The merge file Z1.0 is run at the end


3. CC_analys folder contains two sub-folders: dataset and do-files, and a Codebook (csv file)	
3a. "Dataset" contains the final dataset produced after processing the data using raw data and do-files in CC_org
3b. "do-files" folder contains Stata code (in separate do-files) to produce figures, model outputs, run
